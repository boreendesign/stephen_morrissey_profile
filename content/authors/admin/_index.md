Over many years I have been an entrepreneur and love the challenge of finding new and innovative strategies to building products and services. I am an advocate for the Backwards Press Release where I have wrote articles about this process and other helpful tools for business on my blog www.simpleseattle.biz. I have also worked closely with Jay Lyman of the Seattle Public Libraries 'Library to Business Program’ and have co-lead workshops. One of these workshops was demonstrating how to use Trello who we worked alongside to help people organize both their personal and business projects.

During my time as Project Manager and Technical Project Manager, I oversaw all facets of the project lifecycle; from planning, risk assessment, resource management, product development, QA to delivery. I have built strong working relationships with coworkers and clients, while ensuring cooperation among company departments, often remotely. Having a background in many different areas of technology and business, has been an invaluable asset. I have been able to manage a project in a streamlined way, especially communicating with managers and colleagues from a more technical role.

In my free time, I love working on my own projects with various colleagues, often building them from scratch or using Drupal as the underlying framework. Having 7 years of experience working with custom CMS-driven websites using Drupal. I enjoy building sites that are user-centric, based on user testing and market research. I am very excited for Drupal 8’s headless possibilities and configuration management to better streamline the development process on multiple devices.
