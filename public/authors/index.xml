      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over many years I have been an entrepreneur and love the challenge of finding new and innovative strategies to building products and services. I am an advocate for the Backwards Press Release where I have wrote articles about this process and other helpful tools for business on my blog www.simpleseattle.biz. I have also worked closely with Jay Lyman of the Seattle Public Libraries &amp;lsquo;Library to Business Program’ and have co-lead workshops. One of these workshops was demonstrating how to use Trello who we worked alongside to help people organize both their personal and business projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my time as Project Manager and Technical Project Manager, I oversaw all facets of the project lifecycle; from planning, risk assessment, resource management, product development, QA to delivery. I have built strong working relationships with coworkers and clients, while ensuring cooperation among company departments, often remotely. Having a background in many different areas of technology and business, has been an invaluable asset. I have been able to manage a project in a streamlined way, especially communicating with managers and colleagues from a more technical role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my free time, I love working on my own projects with various colleagues, often building them from scratch or using Drupal as the underlying framework. Having 7 years of experience working with custom CMS-driven websites using Drupal. I enjoy building sites that are user-centric, based on user testing and market research. I am very excited for Drupal 8’s headless possibilities and configuration management to better streamline the development process on multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
